Nanoshield_Ethernet
===================

This is an Arduino library to use Circuitar's Ethernet Nanoshield.

This library is fully compatible with the Arduinoâ€™s default Ethernet library.

* Source code: https://github.com/circuitar/Nanoshield_Ethernet
* Reference board: `Ethernet Nanoshield`_ from Circuitar

Extra feature:

* Power save mode with functions: **Ethernet.powerDown()** and **Ethernet.powerUp()**
* W5100 soft reset: **Ethernet.reset()**

------
Usage:
------

To adapt your code to use this library replace the include from arduino's Ethernet library to this library. Like so:


//#include <Ethernet.h>

#include <Nanoshield_Ethernet.h>

Examples are included in library but you can also use any example from Arduino's Ethernet library.

Examples
--------
The following examples_ are provided:

* WebClient_ connects to a webpage (e.g. google.com).
* WebClientStatic_ connects to a webpage with manual network values (e.g. IP, Gateway, DNS, MAC).
* WebServer_ creates a simple webserver.
